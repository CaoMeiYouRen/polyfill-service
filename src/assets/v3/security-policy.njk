	<p>
		A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed
		security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first
		triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that
		allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.
	</p>
	<p>
		When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable
		time to resolve the issue.
	</p>
	<p>
		We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of
		the projectâ€™s team members at risk.
	</p>

	<h2 id="reporting-a-security-issue">Reporting a security issue</h2>
	<p>
		We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put
		into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you discover a security vulnerability, report the security issue to Jake Champion at <a
		href="mailto:polyfill@jakechampion.name">polyfill@jakechampion.name</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken
		into account to acknowledge your contributions.
